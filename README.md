* To use, paste this script on Krita's Scripter docker (Don't run the script yet)
* Then, enable Show Rulers in the Grid and Guides docker
* Pull a new horizontal guide from the top ruler on the canvas
* Now run the script. The horizontal guide you just created should now follow the cursor!


> this code uses borrowed code from a thread in the Krita forum... it's been sticked together with bubble gum... I don't remember who wrote the code for getting the cursor's position on the canvas, sorry! </3 But I must say I am eternally thankful you did so!
